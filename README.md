# EndlessRunner

Pygame required to play the game

An endless runner, inspired from the chrome dino game, with a little more action and stages implemented. 

Menu added, which has a parllax effect to it. 

Based on your score, new enemies may appear, and you'll also be given a laser at that stage.

Difficulty is definitely a little bit too high, though I've done my best to balance the spacings between dodging objects and flying enemies.

Also a boss fight takes place once you've reached the end of the stage. You'll use your laser to eliminate him.
