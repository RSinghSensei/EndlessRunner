# EndlessRunner
Game created using pygame, just for learning really.
Typical endless game, things regen when they go out of screen
It is a bit challenging to be fair at one point, and needs to get balanced 

Didn't plan on what to do hence it turned out a bit wierd, with messy code and all
Learnt to plan first then code
